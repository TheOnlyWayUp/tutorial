This is as much a reference for myself to simply remember these listeners as it is meant to be useful to others. Use these listeners with care and understanding, if you didn't come here looking for them you probably don't need them, and should turn back. This is not a detailed guide on how to use these listeners, it is just a reference to their existance.</description></item></channel></rss>
