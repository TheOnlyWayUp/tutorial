First, what are allowed mentions? Allowed mentions are a way of telling Discord that you don't want to ping for certain mentions in your message. The different types of ping a message can have are @role pings, @everyone or @here pings, @user pings, and reply pings, all of which we can turn on and off pings for when mentioning.</description></item><item><title>Client vs Bot</title><link>https://vcokltfre.dev/tips/clientbot/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 20:05:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vcokltfre.dev/tips/clientbot/</guid><description>I often see a lot of people using the wrong one, so here's a guide for which you should use.

I won't show the bot code in each example to show just the necessary information, and make this applicable outside of Discord bots too.
You should also be sure when using git to gitignore all of the files you store sensitive information in from any of these examples, to avoide committing them to version control.</description></item></channel></rss>
