This is a page to show credits and special thanks for help people have provided with this tutorial, or things within it.

Firstly, thanks to Danny/Rapptz for making discord.py, without which this tutorial would obviously not exist, nor would countless amazing bots using the discord.py library. His Github profile can be found [here.](https://github.com/Rapptz)

Next, anand/ares initially helped me a great deal with getting the site up on Github pages, and making the first pages version. A link to their Github profile can be found [here.](https://github.com/anand2312)

Enormous thanks to TizzySaurus for sitting for about 2.5 hours with me going through every part making sure it was correct, fixing spelling errors, formatting, and making a bunch more awesome suggestions. I don't know your Github profile, but you helped so much so thanks!

Finally, as much as I don't want to, apparently I should give myself credit, so my Github profile can be found [here :P](https://github.com/vcokltfre), you can support me on Ko-fi [here](https://ko-fi.com/vcokltfre), and the repo for this tutorial can be found [here.](https://github.com/vcokltfre/tutorial)
